# Car Price Prediction Model

## Description
This project focuses on building a car price prediction model using tree-based regression. The model is designed to predict car prices based on various car features. The dataset used for training and testing the model includes details about cars such as the brand, model, year, kilometers driven, fuel type, engine capacity, and horsepower.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project is provided in the "dataset.csv" file. This CSV file contains a total of 75 records, each corresponding to a car and including its features along with the actual price.

## Getting Started
To begin with this project, follow these steps:
1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Upload the "dataset.csv" file to your development environment.
3. Use the provided Python script to perform data analysis, preprocess the data, and build the decision tree regression model.

## Installation
Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed by running the following command:
pip3 install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib

## Usage
1. Open the provided Python script in your preferred development environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab).
2. Load the "dataset.csv" dataset using pandas.
3. Analyze and preprocess the data as necessary.
4. Build the decision tree regression model using scikit-learn.
5. Train the model and evaluate its performance.
6. Use the trained model to predict car prices for new data.
